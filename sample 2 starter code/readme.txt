This sample is a bit bigger than the other one. 
It shows how you can display several users in a window after they are logged in.

To run this code, place all files from this folder together with the API files.
Create the .pro file and load into Visual Studio (or another IDE). Run it!

I included a sample .pro file for Windows.
